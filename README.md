# ATM Transaction Dashboard ‚Äì Revenue & Performance Analysis using Power BI

## 1. Project Overview
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze ATM cost, maintenance, revenue, and transaction performance across various Indian states. It offers a high-level and drill-down view into ATM operations, categorized by state, time period, and transaction ranges.

## 2. Business Problem
Banks operate a large network of ATMs across multiple states and incur recurring costs on maintenance and infrastructure. However, not all ATMs generate the same level of revenue or transactions.
Business needs to identify:

‚Ä¢ Which ATMs or states are underperforming?
‚Ä¢ Where can costs be optimized?
‚Ä¢ How to improve profitability while ensuring uptime?

## 3. Dataset
Type: Simulated data (based on real-world ATM operations)
Tables Used: ATM_Transaction
Columns include: 
Insurance, EJ, Compensation, Penalty, Total Cost, Gross Profit, GROSS PROFIT %, Quarter, ATM TYPE, MARGIN RANGE Current Month, TXN RANGE Current Month, TXN RANGE Previous Month, TXN RANGE Previous 2nd Month, Current Margin Range Above/Below 0%, Previous Month Margin Range Above/Below 0%, Previous 2nd Month Margin Range Above/Below 0%, Previous 3rd Month Margin Range Above/Below 0%, Category, Revenue Performance, Up Time, Month-Yr


## 4. My Work
‚úÖ Data Preparation & Modeling
‚Ä¢ Imported and cleaned raw ATM transaction dataset
‚Ä¢ Structured data model with defined relationships

‚úÖ Dashboard Design & Visualization
‚Ä¢ Developed interactive Overview and Detail pages
‚Ä¢ Created visual KPIs including:
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äî Total Cost
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äî Monthly Revenue
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äî Uptime %
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äî Gross Profit %
‚Ä¢ Visuals used: Column Chart, Multi-Row Cards, Donut Chart, Matrix

‚úÖ User Experience Enhancements
‚Ä¢ Implemented slicers for dynamic filtering
‚Ä¢ Designed custom filter toggle panel using shapes and bookmarks
‚Ä¢ Added page navigation buttons for seamless exploration


## 5. Key Insights
‚Ä¢ States like Mizoram, Manipur, and Meghalaya have the highest average monthly revenue.
‚Ä¢ States such as Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir show lower gross profit % despite uptime above 90%.
‚Ä¢ Majority of ATMs fall under ‚ÄúAbove 30%‚Äù margin range, indicating strong profitability zones.
‚Ä¢ A significant number of ATMs (4126) had more than 200 transactions in the previous month ‚Äî opportunity for scaling.

## 6. Recommendations
‚Ä¢ Reallocate or upgrade ATMs in underperforming states (e.g., Sikkim, Tripura).
‚Ä¢ Investigate cost structure for states with high uptime but low revenue to reduce waste.
‚Ä¢ Promote high-performing states' ATM models and apply those strategies across other regions.
